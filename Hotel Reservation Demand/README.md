# Hotel Reservation Demand

## Motivation

Getting more reservations on one hand and preventing cancelation are two main factors determining a hotelâ€™s revenue. Therefore, My main goal in this project is to get more insights about these two metrics. To this end, I used hotel demand data from Kaggel, to take a closer look at the following questions:

* What is the cancelation difference between hotels and resorts?
* Where do guests who canceled come from?
* Which month does have the highest net reservations?

The dataset has 119,390 records (each of them is one reservation) and 32 features. I focus only on the hotel types, guest countries as well as arrival month in this study to investigate the demand for hotels as well as cancelation rate.
